# NOTE: this script depends on the output from 1.1_make_val_test_files_and_prep_training_files.sh

### DA models need "species-background" training data for their discriminator
# half to train on. This script makes those files, in similar style to the
# 1.2_make_neg_window_files_for_epochs.sh script, which makes the unbound site
# half of the normal training set.

# This script first calculates how large the species-background datasets need
# to be. This will be equal to the size of the training set (bound + unbound
# examples) that is larger between the two species (during training, to keep
# the losses equally balanced, the network is shown the same # of examples of 
# each type of training data). Since this is equal to double the larger # of
# bound training examples, and the species-background training data is made up
# of 50% data from each species, then we can simplify: we need X training
# examples from each species, where X = max(# bound sites used in training)
# across the two species.

# Distinct examples will be used each epoch, to improve diversity of data seen
# by the models, so this script will create one new file for each epoch, for 
# each independent replicate model run.
