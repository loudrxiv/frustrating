### NOTE: this script needs to be run once for each species and TF.

### This script begins the process of making all the files that
# models will use for training, validation, and testing. Specifically,
# this script creates the validation and testing set files for a
# given TF and species, creates the binding training set's bound example files,
# and preps the files that will be used to create the rest of the
# training data: the binding training set's unbound example files
# and the species-background training data files.

# This script should be run before the rest of the scripts in this directory.
# This script should be run after the runall script in the 0_* directory.

# Check starting all.all file exists in correct dir:
# all.all should be a file of all windows to be used for training/testing
# of models from a genome. This file is specific to each TF because it contains
# a column of binary binding labels (TF bound = 1, else 0). The format is TSV,
# with col 1-3 containing BED-format chromosome, start, stop info,
# and the final column containing binary binding labels for a given TF.
# This file is created by genomic window filtering scripts, so it does not
# contain regions filtered due to unmappability or the ENCODE blacklist.
# Specifically, you should have run the scripts in the 0_* directory
# to create these files.
