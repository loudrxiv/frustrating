I really like this picture, actually. I always keep an eye on the [Chatbot Arena](https://lmarena.ai/?leaderboard) and noticed that as of `2024-05-14` Gemini-2.5-Pro-Preview-05-06 was on top. Once you click on the link, you have a few options for generating images; I went with "Gemini 2.0 Flash Preview Image Generation" to make this. I don't remember the prompt, it was something like:

```
Make an image of a dog, human, chimp, rat, and mouse all sitting around a table and looking at a piece of DNA.
```

Followed by:

```
Make it look worse
```

Like three or so times? Pretty comical in my opinion.
